# 5e Feats Rebalanced and Reworked D20 Initiative Compatibility Patch

Compatibility patch for [5e Feats Rebalanced and Reworked](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4379) and [True Initiative](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1115).

## Full Change Set

Below, I've listed every feat, and, if I've changed it, the new text and effects for the feat. For original feat text and effects, see the [BG3 Wiki](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Feats).

_Alert_
Added "During you first turn in combat, you have an amount of temporary hit points equal to your current level, and you have Freedom of Movement."

Notes: 
- If you use the compatibility patch, Alert remains at its base "+5 to Initiative", and also gains the additional features listed above.
- This change makes Alert ever so slightly more powerful and focuses on allowing you to do exactly what you want to do on the first turn of combat, regardless of faster enemies.

# Installation Instructions

For mod installation instructions, see the [wiki](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Guide:Installing_Mods). I performed all my testing using BG3 Mod Manager, and recommend installing the mod using that tool.

## Compatibility Notes (Add to Base Mod)

If you use any mod which modifies BG3 Initiative rolls to use a D20 rather than a D4, make sure to install both the base file and the D20 Initiative Compatibility Patch. Load the D20 Initiative Compatibility Patch after the base file.

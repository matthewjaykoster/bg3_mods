# Tempest Cleric - Thunderbolt Strike Toggle
Tempest Cleric's level six ability, Thunderbolt Stike, is currently bugged. It reads: "When you deal Thunder or Lightning damage to a creature that is Large or smaller, you can also push it up to 3 m / 10 ft.". However, in-game, there is no way to choose whether or not this happens - it ALWAYS happens. This mod aims to fix that.

*Changes*
- Thunderbolt Strike is now a toggleable passive, similar to the Repelling Blast Eldrich Invocation.

# Elixirs Rebalanced
A small mod which rebalances the 4 elixirs which I view as overpowered.

## Description

This mod makes significant changes to the following elixirs:

_Battlemage_
Now grants "Gain one stack of Arcane Acuity and Arcane Change until your next long rest."

_Bloodlust_
Now grants "Once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain 5 Temporary Hit Points and may use a Bonus Action to make an additional main hand melee attack."

_Cloud Giant Strength_
Now grants "Increase your STR by +4, to a maximum of 28."

_Hill Giant Strength_
Now grants "Increase your STR by +2, to a maximum of 22. Increase your CON by +2, to a maximum of 22."

## Purpose
BG3 has a number of changes from base DnD which allow for an immense amount of power at very low cost. Adding "elixers" to the game is one such change, given their common availability and strong effects. Honestly, I like the change. However, I feel like 4 specific elixirs in the game are overtuned. Bloodlust elixir breaks the action economy. Battlemage allows you to land "save or suck" spells far more often than you should. The Giant Strenth potions create crazy damage rider siutations with Tavern Brawler or thrown builds.

So, I've changed in a specific way. I tried to maintain the existing flavor of each elixir while also nerfing each in a significant way.
